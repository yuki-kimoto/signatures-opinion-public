    This site is an opinion blog about Perl Subroutine Signatures. Subroutine Signatures is plan to added to Perl in the near future. I have a very strong concern in the future of Perl, so I created an independent site about sub signatures. My name is Yuki Kimoto. I'm Perl Light User. I have no media power, community power, political power, and big company power. I just feel and talk about the heart of a weak perl user without a voice.

    <h2><a href="/signatures-opinion-public/blog/20191216153849.html">Risk increased by checking the number of subroutine arguments</a></h2>
<p>
  The current subroutine signature specification checks the number of subroutine arguments.
</p>
<p>
  Many people think that this reduces the mistake of checking for incorrect argument count.
</p>
<pre>
sub foo ($args1, $args2) {
  
}

# Exception occur for argument count is difference
foo(1, 2, 3);
</pre>
<p>
  On the other hand, there is actually risks of increasing by checking the argument count.
</p>
<h3>Unexpected exception due to later increase of subroutine arguments</h3>
<p>
  I yet see the discussion that unexpected exception due to later increase of subroutine arguments.
</p>
<p>
  I will explain this with a sample.
</p>
<p>
  First, a subroutine is defined with one argument.
</p>
<pre>
sub foo ($num) {
  
}
</pre>
<p>
  User use this subroutine in many place.
</p>
<pre>
foo(1);

foo(2);

foo(3);
</pre>
<p>
  After a while, you want to pass options to this function and change the code to:
</p>
<pre>
sub foo ($num, $opt) {
  $opt //= {};
}
</pre>
<p>
  The user believes it is the same as the following change:
</p>
<pre>
# Before
sub foo {
  my ($num) = @_;
}

# After
sub foo {
  my ($num, $opt) = @_;
}
</pre>
<p>
  Long-time Perl users know that this change doesn't break the source code and this is how it works.
</p>
<p>
  This change is a long practice for Perl users and has been going on for a long time.
</p>
<p>
  On the other hand, checking the number of arguments in a subroutine signature yields different results.
</p>
<pre>
# Unexpected exception
foo(1);

# Unexpected exception
foo(2);

# Unexpected exception
foo(3);
</pre>
<p>
  "The program is broken. An exception is thrown in an unexpected place!"
</p>
<p>
  There is a risk of adding unexpected bugs by checking the number of subroutine arguments.
</p>
<h3>Should I use the default value?</h3>
<p>
  Such an answer seems to be returned to the above problem.
</p>
<p>
  "Should I use the default value?"
</p>
<pre>
sub foo ($num, $opt = {}) {

}
</pre>
<p>
  This is work well in fact.
</p>
<p>
  What is the problem I feel about this?
</p>
<p>
  This is unintended behavior for users who have been using Perl for a long time.
</p>
<p>
  Perl users generally do not expect Perl to be constrained.
</p>
<p>
  Perl users expect that there are no constraints by default.
</p>
<p>
  The presence of constraints by calling the module is the user's choice, but the subroutine signature is a core feature.
</p>
<p>
  If Perl user write the following for long-standing habits, code is broken. 
</p>
<pre>
sub foo ($num, $opt) {
  $opt //= {};
}
</pre>
<p>
  "Oh, in production code, an unexpected exception has occurred! Subroutine signature increases unexpected risk!"
</p>
<p>
  Are we just thinking that adding constraints reduces the risk of mistakes?
</p>
<p>
  Want to add to the discussion that an unexpected exception can break your production code?
</p>
<p>
  Do Perl subroutine signatures require a constraints of number of arguments? 
</p>
<p>
  Isn't it essential?
</p>
<p>
  Is checking the number of subroutines compatible with Perl's dynamic mechanism?
